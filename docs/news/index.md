# Changelog

## capesR 0.2.1 (development version)

- [`search_capes_text()`](https://strategicprojects.github.io/capesR/reference/search_capes_text.md)
  accepts several terms and several fields
  ([\#5](https://github.com/StrategicProjects/capesR/issues/5),
  hugoavmedeiros/capesR). A row is kept when any of the terms occurs in
  any of the fields,
  e.g. `search_capes_text(data, c("varicela", "catapora"), c("titulo", "resumo"))`;
  the new `match = "all"` argument requires every term instead.
  Previously a vector in `term` raised an error.
- [`read_capes_data()`](https://strategicprojects.github.io/capesR/reference/read_capes_data.md)
  text filters (`titulo`, `resumo`) also accept a vector of terms,
  matching rows that contain any of them.
- When nothing matches,
  [`search_capes_text()`](https://strategicprojects.github.io/capesR/reference/search_capes_text.md)
  returns an empty `data.frame` with the same columns as the input
  (previously a `data.frame` with no columns).
- Added unit tests (testthat).
- Repository moved to <https://github.com/StrategicProjects/capesR>,
  which now also holds the history of the original hugoavmedeiros/capesR
  repository.

## capesR 0.2.0

- Data updated from the CAPES open data portal: years 2023 and 2024
  added, and 2019, 2021 and 2022 replaced by the revised files CAPES
  published in 2025 (institution names in those files now use `(CAMPUS)`
  instead of `( CAMPUS )`). The package now covers 1987 through 2024.
- André Leite is now the package maintainer (previously Hugo Vasconcelos
  Medeiros).
- Data hosting moved off OSF. The yearly Parquet files are now listed in
  the new `capes_years` dataset (year, file, url, bytes, md5), which
  replaces `years_osf`.
  [`download_capes_data()`](https://strategicprojects.github.io/capesR/reference/download_capes_data.md)
  reads the URL from that table, so the host can change without touching
  the code.
- [`download_capes_data()`](https://strategicprojects.github.io/capesR/reference/download_capes_data.md)
  gains a `base_url` argument (default `getOption("capesR.base_url")`)
  to download from a mirror, downloads to a temporary `.part` file
  first, checks the file size, and warns about requested years that are
  not available.
- [`read_capes_data()`](https://strategicprojects.github.io/capesR/reference/read_capes_data.md)
  text search now works on the actual column names of the data
  (`titulo`, `resumo`); it previously only recognised `title`, so
  `filters = list(titulo = "...")` silently matched nothing.
- [`read_capes_data()`](https://strategicprojects.github.io/capesR/reference/read_capes_data.md)
  no longer loads the whole dataset into memory just to read the column
  names.
- Repository moved to <https://github.com/milkway/capesR>.
